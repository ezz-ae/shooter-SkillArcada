## Core Features:

- Instant Purchase: Implement a system to purchase items, immediately debiting the user's account. Call it 'Buy & Vault'

- Dynamic Delivery: Apply shipping separately with option to ship any time, giving users to decide to ship. They can buy today and ship at a later time. Products for sale are dropshipped, where you partner with wholesalers who stock your product.
- Algorithmic Pricing: Use an LLM as a tool to set randomized disscount amount based on a market prices
- The Trade-In Vault: Design an intuitive dashboard, dubbed "Trade-In," that allows the user to chose non-shipped products, showing current re-sell value based on discount fluctuations.
- Disscount Price Returns: Timer starts if decided to return a non-shipped product which users do not chose to immediately do, making it returned at the moment price/disscount
